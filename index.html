Perhaps 10 years ago its relevance didn’t hold up, but websites have since become the backbone of many businesses, both big and small. Think of it as your digital home – a place where you get to invite guests over to introduce them to your brand and the product or service you offer.
    
                        Your customers are adapting to the digital age and all it has to offer, and so should you. Below we outline 10 Reasons Why It Is Important to Have a Website.</p>
    
                    <strong>REasons for Advocating a business entity to invest in a having website.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Tells people who you are and what you do
    
    
                            A website is no different to an interview. It’s the space where you’re able to introduce yourself to potential clients, provide insight into the product or service you offer, how you are able to help them and your background story. It’s also the place where people can connect with your brand and decide whether you’re the “ideal candidate” for the job.
                            </li>
                        <li>1. 24/7 access
                            Unlike a physical store or an office that has set hours during which they trade, your website is open for business 24/7. This allows your customers access to view your website, submit queries or make purchases as and when needed.</li>
    
                            <li>3. Builds credibility
                                If you want to position yourself as a reputable company who people can trust and want to do business with, then your first impression needs to be a lasting one. Being credible will easily convince potential clients to buy from you.</li>
                                <li>4. Keeps customers informed
    
    
                                    If there’s constant change taking place within your business – new products you’re launching, promotions or specials you’re offering or company related updates you need to inform clients of, your website will help keep people in the loop.
